## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Responsive Web design approach
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS Preprocessor

### What I learned

I took the time to step outside my comfort zone and create this project with React.js. I have made other projects with react but I am proud to say I created this all from my own work and/or research.


### Continued development

If I were ever to revisit this project, I would add responsiveness for other devices and tablets.

### Useful resources

- [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/deploy-a-react-app-to-github-pages/) - This site helped me learn how to properly deploy a React application from my terminal.
